Numbers
Javascript has only one number type (no ints, floats, etc)
Basic Math
+, -, /, *, %

** Exponentiateion - Raise to some power
2^4 is 2**4

% Modulo
9 % 2 = 1
Common for determining if a number is even or odd

PEMDAS

Comments
//

NaN
Not a number (technically a number itself in JS) - Represents non-numerical things
0/0 = NaN
1+NaN= NaN

Variables

Variables are not automatically updated in JS
// Define a variable called myLuckyNumber and set it equal to 37
let myLuckyNumber = 37;

+= is a change to a variable 
score += 5 will add 5 to the score

const - same as let, but cannot be changed

var - old way to declare variables, and now that const and let exist, not necessary to use it

Strings
Don't Mix '' and "" unless you need to express one or the other.
camelCaseForTheWin

let bestColor = "purple";
let quote = 'You had me at "hello"'

Strings are indexed

.length method gives you the length of a string in human (not computer) terms

methods

thing.method() will do an action of the method

let msg = "hello world       ";
// Output = "hello world      "
let bigMsg = msg.trim().toUpperCase();
// Output = "HELLO WORLD"

(you can chain together multiple methods in this way)

Finished learning about inline string methods and literals and such. Null and Undefined as well. Moving on to section 16!
Javascript decisionmaking today - logic and boolean stuff!
