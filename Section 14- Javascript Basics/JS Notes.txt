Numbers
Javascript has only one number type (no ints, floats, etc)
Basic Math
+, -, /, *, %

** Exponentiateion - Raise to some power
2^4 is 2**4

% Modulo
9 % 2 = 1
Common for determining if a number is even or odd

PEMDAS

Comments
//

NaN
Not a number (technically a number itself in JS) - Represents non-numerical things
0/0 = NaN
1+NaN= NaN

Variables

Variables are not automatically updated in JS
// Define a variable called myLuckyNumber and set it equal to 37
let myLuckyNumber = 37;

+= is a change to a variable 
score += 5 will add 5 to the score

const - same as let, but cannot be changed

var - old way to declare variables, and now that const and let exist, not necessary to use it
