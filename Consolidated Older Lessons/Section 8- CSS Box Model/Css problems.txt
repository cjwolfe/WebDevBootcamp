It's getting harder and harder to really communicate that I am doing
and viewing things on udemy. I don't always need to do activities and
I don't always need to add stuff to this folder.
I'm on video 88 as of today.

It's so crazy to think that most of this stuff... I already knew. I did my 
flight pay workbench project and that used CSSgrid for crying out loud. I am just
going through the motions of what I need in order to create a representation
that I am "doing work". However, on github, I am just working to make it look
like I am dedicated to this.

I know this. You know this.

But I have to play a weird kind of attendance charade to make it look like I am
"doing work"
but the work is learning and making sure I have this knowledge.
Am I going to be a star developer after this?
Maybe.

I feel like I have more of a shot to be successful at computer science than anything else

My thigh-high socks tell me so.

Kirby, you better get me some thigh-highs this christmas. I don't even care if it's as a joke lol
